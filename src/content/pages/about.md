Hi, I'm Nathan, a 27-year-old data analyst originally from New Zealand. Growing up in the North Island, I developed a passion for exploring data and uncovering meaningful insights, which has shaped my career journey.

After completing my studies in Psychology and Criminology and earning an MSc in Forensic Psychology, I dove into the world of data analysis. I have over two and a half years of experience in data analysis, where I primarily used SQL and Power BI to complete my day-to-day tasks.

Throughout my projects, I’ve leveraged a variety of tools and technologies to bring my ideas to life. These include Python, where I utilize libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web scraping, as well as SQLAlchemy for database management. My proficiency in Power BI has been instrumental in creating insightful data visualizations, and I’ve also gained hands-on experience with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to these technical skills, I'm continuously working on enhancing my coding abilities by setting up new projects, which allow me to explore different aspects of data collection, analysis, and presentation.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong communication and teamwork skills to every project I undertake. My background in customer-facing roles has honed my ability to communicate complex information clearly and build empathetic relationships. I'm also a quick learner and adaptable, which has allowed me to thrive in diverse environments and take on new challenges with confidence. Whether it's collaborating with a team or working independently, I approach each task with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to delivering quality results.

I'm currently living in Bangkok, where I moved to take a short career break and embrace new life experiences. This break has allowed me to explore my interests further and dive deeper into the world of coding, where I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and grow. To do this, I’m setting myself various projects to enhance my skills.

When I'm not buried in data, you can find me exploring local food scenes, playing the guitar, or traveling. I’m always up for new challenges, whether it's tackling a tricky dataset or finding the best hawker stall in a new city.

If you have any questions or want to work with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you!
